## 🔥 Firebase Console - What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Access Firebase Console
Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
Select project: **nuestro-aniversario-20866**

### Step 2: Enable Firestore Database
1. Click "Firestore Database" in the left menu
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" 
4. Select location: `southamerica-east1` (or nearest)
5. Click "Enable"

### Step 3: Enable Firebase Storage
1. Click "Storage" in the left menu
2. Click "Get started"
3. Choose "Start in test mode"
4. Use the same location as Firestore
5. Click "Done"

### Step 4: Configure Security Rules

#### For Firestore (Database → Rules tab):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: true;
      allow write: true; // ⚠️ Change this for production
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Storage (Storage → Rules tab):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: true;
      allow write: true; // ⚠️ Change this for production
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Initialize Data in Your App
1. Run the app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/secreto`
3. Go to "Configuración" tab
4. Click "Inicializar Datos"
5. Wait for confirmation

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

### Before
- Bundle size: ~670 KB
- Single chunk for all code
- Images load immediately (blocking)

### After
- Bundle size: ~400 KB (40% reduction)
- Split into chunks:
  - vendor-react: 43.79 KB
  - vendor-firebase: 378.01 KB
  - Route chunks: 1-22 KB each
- Images lazy load (Intersection Observer)

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current State (Development)
- ✅ Firebase configured
- ⚠️ Open read/write rules (for testing)
- ⚠️ No authentication required
- ⚠️ `/secreto` route is public

### For Production (Recommended)
1. Implement Firebase Authentication
2. Restrict Firestore rules to authenticated users
3. Restrict Storage rules to authenticated users
4. Protect `/secreto` route with authentication
5. Add admin role checks

See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for detailed security recommendations.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Firebase not connecting?
- Check that Firestore is enabled in Firebase Console
- Check that Storage is enabled in Firebase Console
- Verify security rules allow read/write
- Check browser console for errors

### Images not uploading?
- Verify Storage is enabled
- Check Storage security rules
- Check file size (Firebase has limits)
- Check browser console for errors

### Data not saving?
- Verify Firestore is enabled
- Check Firestore security rules
- Check network tab in browser dev tools
- Look for errors in browser console
